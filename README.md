# Master-Python-Programming
In this Repo we are going to walk through Programming in Python language to help you master the syntax and other aspects of the language
 

### **Beginner Level: Getting Started with Python**
1. **Basics of Python**
   - Install Python and set up an IDE (VSCode, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook).
   - Learn syntax: variables, data types (int, float, str, bool), input/output.
   - Understand basic operators: arithmetic, comparison, and logical.

   **Practice:**
   - Write a program to calculate the area of a circle.
   - Create a simple calculator.

2. **Control Flow**
   - If-else statements.
   - Loops (for and while).
   - Break, continue, and pass.

   **Practice:**
   - Write a program to find even numbers between 1-100.
   - Create a number guessing game.

3. **Functions**
   - Define and call functions.
   - Parameters, arguments, and return statements.
   - Default arguments and keyword arguments.

   **Practice:**
   - Write a function to check if a number is prime.
   - Create a function to find the factorial of a number.

### **Intermediate Level: Building Blocks**
1. **Data Structures**
   - Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.
   - List comprehensions.
   - Understand when to use each structure.

   **Practice:**
   - Write a program to count the frequency of characters in a string.
   - Sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.

2. **File Handling**
   - Reading and writing files.
   - Handling exceptions with try-except.

   **Practice:**
   - Write a program to read and display a text file.
   - Create a program to append user input to a file.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and objects.
   - Methods, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
   - Special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`.

   **Practice:**
   - Create a class to represent a bank account.
   - Implement a basic inventory management system.

4. **Modules and Libraries**
   - Using built-in modules (os, math, random).
   - Installing and using external libraries (pip).

   **Practice:**
   - Create a random password generator using the `random` module.
   - Use the `os` module to list all files in a directory.
